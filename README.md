Week 2: Excel-based ectronic sales analysis &amp; dashboard project

# International Distribution Analysis & Operations Dashboard
Project Overview

This project analyzes international distribution performance using operational and financial data. The goal was to evaluate delivery efficiency, profitability, discount behavior, and salesperson performance, then translate raw data into actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard supports decision-making in logistics, pricing strategy, and sales performance management.

# Business Problem

International distribution operations were experiencing inconsistent delivery performance and unclear profitability drivers.
Management needed visibility into:

- On-time delivery performance
- Revenue and profit trends
- Discount behavior and outliers
- Salesperson contribution
- Regional distribution patterns

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel( Pivot Tables)
- Dashboard design & KPI tracking
- Data cleaning
- What-if scenario modeling
- Business analytics
- Performance visualization
- Operational KPI analysis

## Dashboard KPIs
The dashboard tracks:

- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Total Revenue
- Gross Profit
- Average Order Value
- Margin %

It also includes filters by region, country, and salesperson for interactive analysis.

## Focus Areas
1. Operations Performance - Measured delivery lead times to evaluate logistics efficiency.
2. Profitability Analysis - Calculated gross profit and margin % to assess sustainability of pricing strategy.
3. Discount Behavior - Identified extreme discount outliers that may negatively impact margins.
4. Sales Performance - Compared salesperson contribution to compare performances.
5. Scenario Modeling - Applied what-if adjustments to simulate pricing and cost changes.

## Key Insights

1. On-time delivery performance is low at 27%. Late deliveries can directly impact customer satisfaction, repeat business, and brand trust — especially in international distribution where reliability is a competitive advantage.
2. Margin stability is unstable. If delivery inefficiencies continue, hidden costs (returns, expedited shipping, complaints) could erode profit quickly.
3. A small group of salespeople drive most revenue. This is risky in case they leave or burn out.
4. Extreme discount outliers reduce profitability(43–50%). There needs to be a discount governance policy in place and must be approved.

## What I Learnt and Need to Work on

1. Translating business questions into measurable KPIs
2. Building interactive dashboards
3. Identifying operational risk through data and able to come up with recommendations
4. Structuring data for scenario modeling
5. Automating data refresh with Power BI
6. Predictive delivery performance modeling
7. Sales performance forecasting
